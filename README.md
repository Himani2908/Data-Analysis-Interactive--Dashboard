# Data-Analysis-Interactive--Dashboard
I developed an interactive Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard using Microsoft Excel. Performed data cleaning and transformation using Power Query Editor, created Pivot Tables and Charts, and designed a dynamic dashboard with slicers and KPIs to analyze patient trends, waiting times, and operational performance.
