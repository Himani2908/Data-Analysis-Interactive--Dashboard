# Hospital Emergency Room Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
## Project Purpose
The objective of this project is to develop a Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard using Microsoft Excel to enhance operational efficiency and generate actionable insights. This dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor key performance indicators, analyze patient flow and service trends, and support data-driven decision-making to improve patient management and overall healthcare service quality.
## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/Himani2908/Data-Analysis-Interactive--Dashboard/blob/main/Project.xlsx">data</a>
## KPI Requirements
-	Number of Patients: Track daily ER patient count and identify trends.
-	Average Wait Time: Monitor average patient waiting time and highlight delays.
-	Patient Satisfaction Score: Measure daily satisfaction levels to evaluate service quality and detect performance issues.
-	
 ## Charts to Create:
-	Patient Admission Status: Show how many patients were admitted vs. not admitted.
-	Patient Age Distribution: Group patients by age.
-Timeliness: Measure the percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes.
-	Gender Analysis: Display the number of patients by gender.
-	Department Referrals: Check which departments patients are referred to the most.

## Project Process
-	Imported, cleaned, and transformed data using Power Query.
-	Performed data modeling and created calculated columns using Power Pivot (DAX).
-	Built Pivot Tables, developed charts, and designed an interactive dashboard.

## Project Insights
-	On average, the Emergency Room handles a high volume of patients with an average wait time of 34.9 minutes and a satisfaction score of 5.30.
-	Admission rates remain nearly balanced (49% admitted vs. 51% not admitted), indicating most cases are managed without hospitalization.
-	Adults (30–39 years) and seniors (60–69 years) represent the highest patient visit segments.

 ## Final conclusion 
  The majority of patients arrive on time and require minimal departmental referrals, with General Practice being the most common referral category.
The hospital should focus on reducing average wait times and improving service responsiveness to enhance patient satisfaction. Optimizing staff allocation during high-visit age groups and peak hours can further improve patient flow efficiency. Continuous monitoring of KPIs will help maintain operational performance and support better patient management decisions.
